STUDIO GHIBLI MOVIE DATABASE

BRIEF
Your task is to create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

MVP
The application should display data from an API request.
The application should have a clear separation of concerns (multiple components)
Take input from the user to update the page. You could update the page by filtering or manipulating the data on user interaction, or you might make further API requests to load more data that is then displayed.

EXTENSIONS
Looking into a library to visualise the data.
You will need to use the library's documentation to integrate it into your application.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
This app was built in ReactJS using JavaScript, JSX and CSS languages, and using an external API for the displayed data.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
1. To run this app, clone the git repository.

2. Open up the terminal then cd into the studio_ghibli_app folder and run the following command:
      npm install

   This will install the relevant dependencies require to run the app to your system.

3. Next, run the following command in the terminal:
      npm start
   
   This will start the app and open it in a new tab in your web browser at localhost:3000.

4. If your system is unable to run the app, it's possible that you may need to run an update, so run this command in the terminal:
      npm update

   And then run npm start again.

LESSONS FROM THIS PROJECT:
This mini-project was the first app I had built from scratch using ReactJS. The project built on my existing knowledge of passing data through different components of an app, as well as working with data stored in different formats.
