            <h3>The History of Studio Ghibli</h3>
            <p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, and producer Toshio Suzuki. Miyazaki and Takahata had
                already had long careers in film and television animation and had worked together previously on The Great Adventures of Horus, Prince
                of the Sun in 1968 and the Panda! Go, Panda! films in 1972 and 1973. Suzuki was an editor at Animage manga magazine, a role which
                brought him into contact with Miyazaki and Takahata to discuss the Horus film. Miyazaki and Suzuki eventually decided to begin their
                own production company together and invited Takahata to join them.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun "ghibli", based on the Libyan Arabic name for hot desert wind, the idea
                being that the studio would "blod a new wind throug hthe anime industry."</p>
